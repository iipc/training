# Welcome! 

This is the future home of training curriculum produced by the Training Working Group of the International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC), in conjunction with the Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC). For more information about the working group activities see http://netpreserve.org/about-us/working-groups/training-working-group/ 

# Introduction

This set of initial training materials focuses on Beginner topics. Note it is anticipated that future modules and materials produced will cover intermediate and advanced topics.

# IIPC Beginner’s Training: How to Use

The training content in this package aims to provide a complete beginner’s level training course in web archiving. As such the course modules:

* Outline what web archives are, why they are important, and how they work.
* Demonstrate how to build a case for web archiving and develop policy.
* Provide attendees with the skills/tools needed to implement a basic web-archiving workflow.

# Target Audiences

The following table includes a list of potential audiences for this training. In preparing the training content, an audience with no prior knowledge of web archiving was assumed, so there are no prerequisites for understanding beyond a general familiarity with archives, libraries or some other form of information management.

# Resources Included

This course contains 8 sessions in total, with session 3 broken into sub-sections due to length. For each session there are presentation slides, accompanied by complete speaker notes. Most of the sessions include discussion questions to encourage attendee interaction, and two sessions also include group work exercises (sessions 5 and 8) for which guidance notes and worksheets are available as appropriate. A complete listing of the training sessions is included in the table below.

# Customizing the Training

These materials should be thought of as a starting point for those interested in learning more but also sharing the training material with others. We assume customization based on local examples and environments will be necessary and desired by users of the material. Several of the training sessions contain discussion questions which can be removed for brevity if needed. Likewise, there are many case study slides which could potentially be removed, or, more likely, changed for examples relevant to the context in which the training is being delivered. The risk management exercise in session 5A contains a scenario based on a community archive, this might also be replaced if something more relevant to your context.
